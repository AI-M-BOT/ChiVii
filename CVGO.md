## 📝📝📝Note:
* If you want to use GHUB mouse simulation method, you MUST use old version of GHUB driver (older than 2022.03), or use LGS instead, or use provided [patch](https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/ltovos/how_to_install_old_ghub_works_no_auto_update/) to reverse back GHUB version
* **Password is provided through #ticket of my Discord server**
* Don't include "ID: " or "KEY: " when entering...... But need to include that "key/" which is not capitalized
* Arduino code not work for all mouses (this one supports most mouses include Logitech and Razer), need to be modified if not working well
* You MUST test turn around data using [turn_around.exe](Test_turn_around/turn_around_ex.exe) first and every time after you changed mouse sensitivity settings, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOcmX9fnZJk) is how to use it


<br/><br/>

## 🎈🎈🎈Promotion:
* Join **[Discord](https://discord.gg/8N6ehqjQwH)**, read information and create ticket
* AIMBOT IS NOT free, join the server for details (please read), but I will also release a free version
* There is a FREE weights shared previously for people who want to code their own program. Enjoy. (class 0: head; class 1: body, 416*416, Yolov4-tiny)
* Also a slightly modified version of [labelimg](Free_stuffs/labelImg_cx.exe), with zoom up to 1000% and no fuzzy, better for moving tiny labels
* Proof of [work on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1kzhw9tZ18)
* BE A PRO IN CSGO/CROSSFIRE/VALORANT/APEX/NZ/PUBG & so on !!!

<summary>Arduino Leonardo + USB host shield</summary>

* External hardware (Arduino Leonardo + USB host shield) can be purchased at [Amazon - Arduino Leonardo](https://www.amazon.com/KEYESTUDIO-Leonardo-Development-Board-Arduino/dp/B0786LJQ8K/) and [Amazon - USB host shield](https://www.amazon.com/ARCELI-Shield-Arduino-Support-Android/dp/B07J2KKGZ4/) or [Ebay - USB host shield](https://www.ebay.com/itm/393311967986)
* [Here](https://github.com/AI-M-BOT/The_University_of_League_Cheats/tree/main/Arduino) is all the files you need for Arduino
* Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dxwU87GQVM) shows how to solder it to avoid a no power problem
* This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5znFDmY5V4) briefly go through steps how to upload code to Arduino device (pls ignore the coding part since i did that for you, also in our case we are using Leonardo instead of UNO)
* This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlUyUGYHMAc) basically covers all the details when using Arduino device to simulate mouse actions
* If you choose to use Arduino, do realize that you need to solder those three lacations ![image](Arduino/Notice.png)

## 📆📆📆Upcoming:
* ⭕Tutorial
* ⚠Using TRT to boost speed (done, planned to add only in pro version, done, evaluating, seems not necessary)
* ✅Using new "nice-looking" gui (Done)
* ✅Safer version which pure relies on python.exe (Done)
* ✅Support Arduino Leonardo + USB host shield (Done)
* ⚠Hide process from task manager (Done, test not safe)
* ⭕Better weights for Valorant and PUBG (ongoing)
* ✅Accurate recoil control for some games (Done for CSGO, available only in pro version)
* ⭕Players can download at different time will get different files (with same file names but content changed)
* ✅[Free version](https://github.com/JiaPai12138/AI-M-BOT)
* ⭕More organized gui(ongoing, only in pro version)

## 👍👍👍Features:
* Different checksum for different user
* One program works on many fps games
* Light weight YOLO AIMBOT with fantastic performance (low GPU usage)
* Well-trained models
* Does not read/write memory, no virus and fill free to scan (except for ESET which take all packers as potential virus)
* Smooth human-like mouse move at all FPS values, random speed of mouse clicks
* Custom shortcut keys, custom mouse move speed, custom aiming positions, various supported battle modes
* Standalone RCS for CSGO
* Enhanced object tracking using PID system (optimized for both static and moving targets)
* Support different types of mouse simulation to bypass *** platforms
* Welcome to try with your secondary accounts, see the facts with your own eyes without losing and regretting
